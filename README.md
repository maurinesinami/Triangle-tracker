## 1.Equilateral triangle 

.It has all sides equal
For example:side A =2,side B =2, side C = 2.
The output will be an 'Equilateral triangle'.

## 2.Isosceles triangle.

It has only two sides equal.
For example: side A =2,side B =2, side C= 3.
The output will be an 'Isosceles triangle'.

## 3. Scalene triangle 

All its sides are not equal.
For example:side A =2, side B= 3,side C =4.
The output will be a 'Scalene triangle'.

4. If the sum of two sides are less than the third side then the output will 'NOT BE A DEFINATE TRIANGLE '.
